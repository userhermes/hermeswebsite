								Hi! I am a  first year PhD student of the Centre for Doctoral Training in Theory and Simulation of Materials at Imperial College London. I am based at the Department of Materials studying nano-systems that could improve the treatment of cancer. The aim is to achieve suitable nanotechnology that enables targeted drug delivery, photo-thermal therapy and live imaging of tumour tissue. I enjoy playing badminton, music and meeting new (and old) friends!

								Hi, I am a post-graduate researcher at Imperial College London under the 
								supervision of Dr. Paul Tangney and Prof. Peter Haynes. We work on improving the description 
								of electrostatic interactions in atomistic Force Fields models that are fit to Density 
								Functional Theory. Successful improvements have the potential to greatly aid the fidelity of simulations
								of such important systems as metal oxide interfaces and nanoparticles!
								I love both British and the international scientific community and seek to get involved in
								various events such as outreach or organizing conferences and workshops.
								Outside of science I enjoy exploring the numerous vibrant neighborhoods of London by 
								bicycle and playing football in Hyde Park.

								Hi, I'm Freda and I'm a first year PhD student in the CDT in Theory and Simulation of Materials at Imperial College.
								I'm based in Chemical Engineering and spend my time modelling the flow of liquids through nanoporous membranes using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics. These membranes have the potential to be used in various filtration systems, e.g. water purification, and could make these more efficient and reduce capital cost (saving the world one desalination plant at a time).
								When I'm not doing that you can usually find me playing rugby or in the pub.

								<h3>Farnaz Ostovari</h3>

							<a href="#" class="image centered"><img src="images/farnaz3.jpg" alt="" style="width: 75%;" /></a>
						
							<p>
								I achieved my first degree in Mechanical Engineering from Imperial College London, 
								where I was introduced to material science and it's application in different technologies such as jet engines. 
								Then I joined TSM_CDT at Imperial College London to further improve my skills and knowledge in material science and modelling. 
								Currently I am studying SiC/SiC woven composites and environmental barrier coatings using meshfree methods. 
								I attended the Hermes Summer School of 2014 and improved my science communication skills, while meeting bright and interesting people in the field. 
								This inspired me to take part in organising the next Hermes summer school.

							<a href="#" class="image centered"><img src="images/ado3.jpg" alt="" style="width: 75%;" /></a>
							
							<p>
								I am a PhD student in Computational Mechanics at Imperial College London. I am now working on a research project on the numerical simulation of particle stress and fracture, 
								together with the Applied Modelling and Computation Group and in a collaboration with Johnson Matthey Technology Centre. 
								I was born in Monza (near Milan), in Italy, and before coming to live in the UK in 2013 I have studied at Politecnico di Milano (Polytechnic University of Milan), 
								where I have earned a Bachelor’s degree in Building Engineering and a Master’s degree in Structural Engineering. 
								My main research interests are oriented towards computational mechanics and its applications to fracture propagation, 
								structural mechanics, heat transfer and acoustics.
								When I am not busy running computer simulations or making experiments with high-velocity impact testing machines, 
								I also sing (mostly jazz and rock) and play guitar.

							<p>
								I am a PhD student at Georg August University of Göttingen, Germany. At our research group under the guidance of Prof. Marcus Müller we conduct 
								large scale computer simulations of biological and soft matter systems. My main reseach utilizes Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo methods to study 
								structural and energetic properties of self-assembled organic monolayer on liquid metal surfaces. Apart from science I am also fond of science fiction, 
								foreign languages and different types of sport such as yoga and swimming. I also enjoy travelling and meeting new people. Hope to see you all at 
								Hermes 2016!

							<p>
                            I am a PhD student in the Centre for Doctoral Training in Theory and Simulation of Materials at Imperial College London. I work across the departments of Physics, Mechanical Engineering and Materials/Nuclear Engineering. My research is on the mathematical theory and multiscale modelling of diffusion in fractured continua, employing methods from theoretical solid mechanics and irreversible thermodynamics; the overarching aim of this work is to describe a hydrogen embrittlement mechanism that affects modern nuclear reactor technology. I am also interested in science outreach and communication to the public and media.
