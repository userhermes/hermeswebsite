								<h3>A Brief History of Hermes</h3>
							</header><br>
							<p>
                            The first Hermes summer school took place during the 2012 Olympics. The late Julian Walsh, an advocate of personal development of students at Imperial College, booked Cumberland Lodge on a whim as it just happened to be available and told the students to ‘do something’ with it. From this acorn came an international summer school that would get together PhD students from around the world for a conference featuring leading academics and an innovative programme. To this day the conference continues to be completely student-led and is going from strength to strength.

								<h3>Aims and Ethos</h3>
							</header>
							<p>
							Hermes has four main aims, which are prerequisites for quality, impactful research:
							<ul>
							<li>&#x25CF;  Provide training in the techniques in materials modelling and prediction beyond the remit of both their own PhD field and discipline. </li>							
							<li>&#x25CF;  Develop the communication skills of the attendees so they are better able to communciate their research clearly and effectively.</li>
							<li>&#x25CF;  Use innovative learning and teaching strategies to ensure a high quality programme.</li>
							<li>&#x25CF;  To develop a lasting international network of PhD students.</li>							
							</ul> 
							</p>

								<h3>Materials Modelling</h3>
							</header><br>
							<p>
Hermes invites world-leading academics to give pedagogical talks on the methods they use. They are invited to stay for the duration of the conference allowing attendees to chat to them casually about the talk and their work in general. Talks also feature "break-out" sessions to allow discussions among peers. All these strategies aim to give the attendees basic understanding of the techniques as well as a flavour of the speakers own research.

								<h3>Science Communication</h3><br>
							</header>											
							<p>
Whatever path attendees take after their PhDs they will need to be good communicators. A lot of research is publically funded and as such it is vital that the public should be informed and inspired by it. It is also equally important for careers in industry; being able to communicate technical results to non-specialists could be the difference between a pitch being picked up or not. There are now more ways than ever to communicate with the public, thus we need to ensure the next generation of scientists is able to present their research is an enganging way to a wide variety of audiences.

								<h3>Innovative Learning</h3>
							</header><br>
							<p>
							Research into effective learning and teaching styles have provided us with many more ways of transferring skills in an inspiring and engaging way. Hermes utilises technology and peer-led learning techniques to make the content accessible and, hopefully, fun. We seek to inspire, inform and educate in a way that creates a lasting impact on the attendees.

								<h3>International Networks</h3>
							</header><br>
							<p>
We live in an increasingly global world: nowhere is this more true than in research. Experts are often scattered all over the world from a variety of backgrounds. Hermes aims to give the next generation more experience in working with people from different backgrounds and cultures than they would otherwise. We also aim to make Hermes a wider support and research network that survives beyond the duration of the conference. Attendees and speakers all dine together and this gives ample opportunity to speak in an informal setting about the challenges they may face. Additionally, we are hoping to foster relations between industry and scientific research as both can greatly benefit from each other.
